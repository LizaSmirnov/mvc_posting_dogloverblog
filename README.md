## Description
This app is used using MVC(Model View Controller) and handlebars to make an easier app than just using sequelize on its own. With Handlebars we are able to link everything more seamlessly. The first page lands you on the homepage where you can see both user's posts and user comments. Want to sign up or log in? Links are available on the top nav bar. Once you are logged in on the Profile page you can create, view and delete your own post. If you go to the home page while logged in you can now comment on another user's post.

## Installation
Hard Way: Please download the following on your command line "npm i". Please enter into your code editor and make sure all npm packages are installed by checking your package.json file. From there you will need to run "mysql -u root -p". Please drop the database from the schema file. Please make sure to have updated your password in a .env file. You will also need to source the schema.sql while on mysql and click into the posting_db by first typing "GET tables;" and then "use post_db". From there you can exit and from the server, you can run the seeds. After that, you can launch to localhost using nodemon. 

Easy Way: nothing! Just enjoy the Heroku link above!
