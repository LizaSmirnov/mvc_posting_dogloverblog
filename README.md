## Description
This app is used using MVC(Model View Controller) and handlebars to make an easier app then just using sequelize on it's own. With Handlebars we are able to link everything more streamlessly. The first page lands you on the homepage where you can see both user's post and user comment's. Want to sign up or login? Links are available on top nav bar. Once you are logged in on the Profile page you can create, view and delete your own post. If you go to the home page while logged in you can now comment on another users post. 

## Heroku


## Installation
Hard Way:Please download the following on your command line "npm i". Please enter into your code editor and make sure all npm packages are installed by checking your package.json file. From there you will need to run "mysql -u root -p". Please drop the data base from the schema file. Please make sure to have updated your password in a .env file. You will also need to source the schema.sql while on mysql and click into the posting_db by first typing "GET tables;" then "use post_db". From there you can exit and from the server you can run the seeds. After that you can launch to localhost using nodemon. 

Easy Way: nothing! Just enjoy on the Heroku link above!
